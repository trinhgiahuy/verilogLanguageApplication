## What is Logic Sythesis

- Synthesis tool transforms your RTL Verilog design into an optimized netlist of predefined cells.
- Synthesis tool will meet your design constraints for area and performance, 
design constraints required clock speed, input drive strength & arribal time with respect to clock
 

- infers storage elements (latches, registers)
- infers combinational logic feeding storage elements
- optimizes generated structure to meet cost factors: area/speed/power/routability
